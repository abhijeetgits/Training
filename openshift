Open shift is a hybrid cloud

OPen shift  kubernettesby RHEL is more reliable and they provide live time support
there are kubernettes and AWS ekd

1)docker hub is a place where we can check the images of the container installed
by someone else


> docker search ubuntu

dont download images which are not official,as they might contain ransomware etcs malwares
 
in ubuntu machine apt-get update works but un centos  yum repolist works

> docker run -it ubuntu

instead of installing virtual machine ,we can install containers of ubuntu very quickly

> docker ps to check how many containers are running

2) Here we are using operating system as microservices
3) Kubernettes is used for managing containers
kubernettes was created by google and it donated it cncf
pokemon go uses kubernettes, they had requirements to scale for 1 million users per seconds
hbo is also using kubernettes
redhat has added a lyer of openshift on top of kubernettes, 

4)abhidocks23
5)dockerhub is actually using github as background
we can install container lets say ubuntu and we can install java using 
apt-get update
the main concept of openshift containers is not to install operating system

there are 2 types of linux used RPM And DEBIAN

UNIX was asked by one developer to shared the kernel details butthey refused
by gtelling that they are closed source
hr created luinux kernel, then another companies like RHEL,UBUNTU,CENTOS came and used
these kernels to craete 2 diffrent  falvours RPM based and DEBIAN based

for openshift we have 1 free open source upstream called as okd and its enterprise
version is openshift

docker ee is enterprise edition
docker community edition : post questions and if similar problems arethere
they will push it to company
RH has 3 types of s/ws 

1) FEDORA -upstream for red hat enterprise linux
2)CENTOS
3)REL 

1ST AND 2ND are open source
centos simply downloaded iso image file and simply removed all branding of RH and simply
sold it as its own,
REL is enterprise verion of RH

OKD : openshift container daemon 
requirements 16gb ram and quad core cpu

openshift runs on kubernettes and kubernettes run on pods
we dont use container 

openshift is a cloud and docker is software
docker is a part of openshift

docker cretaes container

limux kernel treats contaimner as a process

pod is a sandbox with multiple containers

pod may contain container all with java, its an isolated environment where each 
project runs

if we have to launch conatiner in docker we have to be root

sudo is different from root
root allows you to delete files also in ubuntu,but sudo (super doer) allows only to
modify the / files

docker took lot of time to resolve the issue of rootless conatiners
strong linux knowledge is needed for openshift
>kubectl get projects

redhat create another layer on top of kubernettes

OC
!
kUBERNETTES

>OC get projects

Open shift is kubernettes solution
open shift is orcahestration tool
>OC status

open shift has web console also where we need not type in commands
2 registries are there
1)docker registry
2) redhat registry

all the images are stored in these regsitries

once we install openshift we will be getting dockers and kubernettes

1) for installing centos
download the iso image copy
go to intallation manager
search for virtaul machin manager
run centos

for installing docker for centos

hypervisor is a tool which is used to create virtual machine

   
virtual machine is a operating system on another machine
eaelir we use to hvae hardware and we used to create partitions and manually install
s/ws on the hardware partitions

but with virtualization we need not do that
in containers when we are downloading ubuntu,it will download only limited features of
ubuntu, thats why when we download ubuntu on server it will require 834 mb but if we download
ubunut in docker it needs only 84 mb,because it has removed bloatwares ,like bloatwares
are something we dont use but they bloat our system

NOw its the responsibility of host kernel to provide resources to containers

  cluster storage
  other storage
  
  >oc get events
  pod is like a sandbox where we can create,modify and autoscale 
  
  persistent volume can be used for storing database
  if our containers gows down ,we can spin off new container and can attach 
  new conatiner with old persistent volume
